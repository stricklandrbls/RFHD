Recursive File Hash Deletion

### Installation
Move the .py file to the directory that you would like to check for duplicate files.
$python3 duplicate_remover.py

### Note
This only takes the file contents hash and checks them so the files have to be IDENTICAL matches. I will try to determine the best possible way to delete files that are 'close enough' to be matches.
